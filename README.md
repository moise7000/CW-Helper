# #InfusingTeam

The main purpose of this repository is to help our team during a coding week project. This project focuses on user input validation in Java, providing reusable utility methods to ensure data integrity and avoid runtime errors.

## Overview

This project contains a class named `UserInputManager`, which centralizes various methods for validating user input. The class includes methods to validate strings, numbers, dates, and other common input types.

The primary goals of this utility are:
- Ensure input adheres to specific formats or constraints.
- Simplify input validation across multiple parts of a project.
- Provide reusable and extensible validation logic.

## Features

The `UserInputManager` includes the following features:
- Validation of integers, doubles, and alphanumeric strings.
- Verification of valid dates and date ranges.
- Checking for specific patterns or allowed characters.
- Ensuring compliance with format-specific input, such as emails, phone numbers, and URLs.
